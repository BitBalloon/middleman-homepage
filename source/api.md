Test <strong>Hello</strong> what now?

### Zapier Integration

BitBalloon's API is integrated with [Zapier](https://zapier.com/developer/invite/3654/fc79b726d2f9f38f33ca4bc36397cb23/) so you can trigger automated tasks when a specific event happens on your site, no programming required! For example, you could create the following recipe with just a couple of clicks:

_"Add a row of data to my Google Spreadsheet when a form submission happens on my site."_

<div class="row">
  <div class="columns small-8 large-6 small-centered">
    <a href="https://zapier.com/developer/invite/3654/fc79b726d2f9f38f33ca4bc36397cb23/" class="large button expand">
      Connect with Zapier
    </a>
  </div>

Click the button above to connect BitBalloon with your Zapier account. It should appear as a 'trigger' service when creating a new Zap. Contact us if you need any help with getting up and running with the Zapier integration.

### Direct API Access

Your applications can interface with BitBalloon directly via OAuth2.
Here's some examples of whats possible once you've authenticated:

* Create, update or delete sites
* Listen for form submission data
* Hook deployment into your workflow (eg. Github)
* Add deployment into your own app (eg. a site generator)
