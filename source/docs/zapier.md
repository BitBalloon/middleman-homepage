## Zapier Integration

BitBalloon's API is integrated with [Zapier](https://zapier.com/developer/invite/3654/fc79b726d2f9f38f33ca4bc36397cb23/) so you can trigger automated tasks when a specific event happens on your site, no programming required! For example, you could create the following recipe with just a couple of clicks:

_"Add a row of data to my Google Spreadsheet when a form submission happens on my site."_
